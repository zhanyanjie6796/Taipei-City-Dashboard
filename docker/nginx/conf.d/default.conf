# This config is recommended for use only in the local development environment
# where the frontend utilizes Vite to launch the web server. It serves as a reverse proxy
# for the domain citydashboard.taipei, redirecting HTTP traffic on port 80 and HTTPS traffic
# on port 443. Additionally, it enforces HTTPS by including the Strict-Transport-Security
# header and specifies SSL certificate settings. Requests are then forwarded to the backend
# services. Note: The commented out sections are examples of how to proxy specific paths
# to backend services.
